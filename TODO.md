#### TODO

- [x] move tests and fixtures next to components
- [ ] update eslintrc to apply test specific rules to all the tests

There are 2 options to achieve the above:

1. Copy the old `tests/.eslintrc.js` file in every `tests` folder or
2. Wait for [glob based configs](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3611).
